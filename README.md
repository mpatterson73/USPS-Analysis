## **U.S. Post Office Analysis**

With the 2020 Presisential election fast approaching, and the huge amount of mail-in
ballots expected to be cast due to COVID-19, the postal service has been front and
center in the news lately. I stumbled accross this webpage,
[Pieces of mail since 1789](https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/postal-history/pieces-of-mail-since-1789.htm). 

I scraped the table containg # of post offices, pieces handled, total revenue and total expenses for each year so I could play around with the data.
